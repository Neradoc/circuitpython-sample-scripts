## displayio text labels examples

Simple placement of text labels on the built-in `board.DISPLAY` for boards having one, and showing off updating the content of the label.

Add your external screen's init code, and your own data source(s).

Don't forget: setup the labels ONCE, change the text in the loop. Don't create the labels in the loop.
